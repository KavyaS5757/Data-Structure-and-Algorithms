? An aeroplane covers a certain distance at a speed of 240kmph in 5 hours. To cover the same distance in 1 and 2/3 hours, it must travel at a speed of?
a) 720km/min
b) 700m/hr
c) 720km/hr
d) 700km/hr
Ans:- (c)

? what is the output of the following code?

public class Solution
{
   public int getSum(int a,int b)
   {
        int sum = a+b;
        return sum;
   }
   public static void main(String args[])
   {
        Solution obj=new Solution();
        System.out.println(obj.getSum());
   }
}


a) 30
b) 0
c) compilation error
d) none of the above
Ans:- (c)
## In the above program, we have defined a method that takes 2 parameters and returns a value. But when we call this method, we have not passed any argument.
Therefore, we got an error

? what is the output of the following code?

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   var1=5;
   var2=6;
   if((var2=1)==var1)
   cout<<var2;
   else
   cout<<(var2+1);
}
a) 7
b) 1
c) 2
d) 6
Ans:- (c)
here var2 is assigned to 1. So before comparison, var2=1 and var1=5 are not equal obviously. So it will go to else part and and add 1 into it.

? what is the output of the following code?

public class Solution
{
   public static void func(int a, int b)
   {
        System.out.println(a+b);
   }
   public static void main(string[arg])
   {
      int a=7;
      func(a,12);
   }
}


a) 12
b) 15
c) 19
d) 29
Ans:- (c)

? what is the output of the following python code?
print([i.lower() for i in "NINJA"])

a) ['n','i','n','j','a']
b) 'ninja'
c) ['ninja']
d) 'NINJA'
Ans:- (a)

? In a row where all are facing north, Priya is 15th from the left end and Garima is 19th from the right end. 
They interchange their positions and Ram who sits 24th from the left end sits at the 5th place to the left of Priya's new position.
How many persons were there in a row?

a) 32
b) 42
c) 47
d) 54
Ans:- (c)
29+19-1

? what is the output of the following code?

#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

class A
{
   float d;
   public:
      int a;
   void modify(int i)
   {
      a=i;
   }
   void getA()
   {
      cout<<a;
   }
};
class B: public A
{
   int a=15;
   public:
      int a;
      void print()
      {
      cout<<a;
      }
};
int main()
{
   B b;
   b.modify(10);
   b.print();
   b.getA();
   return 0;
}

a) 1010
b) 1510
c) 1515
d) 5110
Ans:- (b)
when modify() is called it sets parent class 'a' variable=10. 
When print() is called, then 'a' from class B is printed, and when getA() is called, then 'a' from class A is printed
