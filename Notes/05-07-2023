Difference Between Int Main And Void Main

About int main():-
? What is int return type and its significance?
->The int main() defines the entry or the starting point of the C/C++ program code. 
->Here int is a keyword that tells us about the integer data type. 
->So when one runs the file on their local computer, the operating system executes the main () function. 
->Any code that is written to solve a particular question goes into this main() function which the OS system when calls it, it runs the code.
->Mainly we use this way of defining the function in the C/C++ program. 
->The “int” in the int main() suggests that the “main()” function would return the integer type as an output to the operating system when the program is terminated. 
->When the integer value is returned, it means that the program has been completed. 
->If the return value is 0, it indicates that the program has terminated successfully, while any value other than 0 indicates an error.

? What are argc and argv arguments?
->Any primary function can be called using command line prompting. 
->The main process takes two parameters, out of which one is the argc argument, which is an integer type, and the other is the argv parameter, which is a character type. 
->The first parameter, argv, also called argument count, is an integer that tells us about the number of arguments that were entered in the command line before the program started. 
->The second parameter, argv, also called the argument vector, is an array of pointers that point to the character's objects.

Using int main() Function
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;  // indicates successful termination of the program 
}
Output:
Hello, World!

The above code in C language tells us about implementing the int main() function to print the “Hello World” string. 
The return 0 statement indicates that the program has ended successfully in the main() function.

About void main():-
Significance of void return type
->The void main() function returns no return value when the program is successfully terminated. 
->There is an empty data type. It is used when one doesn’t want to return any value to the main function. 
->In CPP, void main() is one of the ways to define the entry point but in a non-standard way.

? Why is the void main() non-standard and not recommended?
Most OS return a value to the user or the calling process to understand if the program was successful. This is useful in scripting, also. 
To identify if the function was executed and if any error occurred. Thus, it is not used much, is non-standard, and specifically not recommended. 
One more reason why it is not recommended to use is that it can cause compatibility issues with various other compilers. 
Also, it is not recommended because it is not in the standard CPP language.

Using void main() Function
#include <stdio.h>  
#include <conio.h>  
void main()  
{  
printf (" Coding Ninjas");
}
Output-
Coding Ninjas

Differences between int main() and void main()

->Usage                                             Standard and portable                                        Non-standard and risky

->Usage in code                                     Can be used to indicate errors                               Typically not used for errors
->Convention                                        Standard convention in C and C++                             Non-standard and discouraged

->Potential issues                                  Omitting the return value can cause warnings                 Using void main() can cause compatibility issues and

Frequently Asked Questions
? What is the difference between int main() and void main()?
It is one of the ways to initialize the function where the return type is int when the program is successfully terminated. 
If the return value is 0, then the program is successfully terminated, while other values indicate there was some error. 
It is used with the main function, although it does not return any value to the OS when the program is terminated. 
We use this when one doesn’t want any return values at the end of the program.

? Which is better to use int main() or void main()?
The int main() function is much better than the void main() function as it gives us a return value in the form of an integer which lets the user know if the program has run successfully or not. 
At the same time, the void function does not return anything.

? What is the return value for int main() and void main()?
The return value in the int main() function is an integer datatype, while the return datatype in void main() is void. 
The return values in both these types are different; thus, it is better to use int main() as it tells if the program is successful.
